            <h2>Government hikes protesting resident doctor's monthly stipend to Rs48,737</h2>
            <img src="doctor.jpeg" alt="Discussion at PM's Office" width="100%">
            <p>The Medical Education Commission has finally agreed to fix stipends of the post graduate students from private medical colleges on par with that of government-owned colleges.

            <br><br>Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, as the chair of the commission, called an emergency meeting of the commission to decide on stipends after resident doctors started halting non-emergency services. Currently, postgraduate students (MD/MS) from government-owned institutions get Rs48,737 per month, which is equivalent to the salary of a gazetted officer. However, private medical colleges have been paying the same level of students around Rs20,000.</p>
